# ChaosMode
A "Minecraft but..." plugin created by birdsoftheworld and PepperLola.

## What is ChaosMode?
ChaosMode adds several new modes to Minecraft, that are intended to either pose a challenge to the player, or just add more variety to the gameplay.

## How do I use it?
The command `/chaos` brings up a menu that you can use to enable or disable different modes. Click the stained glass below a mode to toggle it. Click on the mode icon to change its settings.
